				In the early stages of photosynthesis, specialized light-harvesting molecules absorb energy from sunlight and transfer that energy to a reaction centre where it can be converted to a chemical form. Interactions between these molecules and their surroundings strongly affect how efficient that energy transfer is. Experiment below by dragging the light-harvesting molecules into different environments to see the effect on the time for energy transfer from the initial molecule (red) to the target molecule (green). Write down your observations of how the energy moves between the molecules then click to see if they agree with ours.
